# popn-naming-type-cost

## Overview

- This script approximately calculates key-stroke counts which need to input certain music game-oriented names.  
- Plus, enables us to compare whether it is more efficient to type title or genre to mention a particular song.
- [This article](https://example.com) is based on the result.

- [pykakasi](https://codeberg.org/miurahr/pykakasi) (to parse Japanese phrase, supports **python 3.6 - 3.9**)
- installing CSV file from [external pastebin](https://example.com)
